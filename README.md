# pMVC
> pMVC is not a framework nor a class library. It´s a simple MVC model for the PHP plattform.

pMVC is a simple MVC model with structure and separate of concerns in mind. It does not contains all the fancy full-fledged framework stuffs like [Zend Framework](https://framework.zend.com "More about Zend Framework"), [CodeIgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com "More about CodeIgniter") or [Symfony](https://symfony.com "More about Symfony"). But it do contains models, views, controllers, helpers, class autoloading and controller-action-routing.

pMVC is running on PHP 5.6.31 and PHP 7 and above, but future versions will be made for PHP 7.x only. You´ll find the documentation in the source.
